# SaXML inventory

**2026-09-16: the legacy Save as XML inspector was retired** after the cross-check in `docs/cross-check-2026-09.md` confirmed the fm CLI inspector accounts for every difference in what it counts. This table is now history, not a checklist — nothing here still gates work. `legacy/clockwork-inspector.html` remains in git history.

One row per datum the legacy inspector reads from Save as XML (parser rows) or renders from the stats object (render rows).
Classification is one of `covered`, `derived`, `gap`, `dropped`. `dropped` marks a datum the new inspector does not need, by owner decision; it is not a gap and is not reported to Claris. `fm` names the catalog and key that supplies it, or the register id for a gap.

| Source | Datum | Classification | fm | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| parseXMLToStats | qs:'parsererror' | covered | runner: parse pipeline replaced by fm NDJSON, no datum | DOMParser error probe. fm returns parsed JSON per op with its own status/error line; there is no XML text to fail on. |
| buildDDRTextIndex | attr:'datatype' | dropped | owner ruling 2026-09-14 | The DDR_INFO display-text index existed to show FileMaker's own pre-rendered text in the Reference Explorer. Not needed in the new inspector, which renders from fm's JSON. (The tokenised references inside DDR_INFO are a separate matter: see catalog-calculation-tokens.) |
| buildDDRTextIndex | qsa:':scope > DDR_INFO' | dropped | owner ruling 2026-09-14 | The DDR_INFO sidecar under every Calculation, used only for the display-text index. Not needed. |
| buildDDRTextIndex | tag:'*' | dropped | owner ruling 2026-09-14 | Walked every element of the DDR_INFO subtree to build the display-text index. Not needed. |
| parseFileMetadata | attr:'action' | covered | — | ScriptTrigger action on the file (OnFirstWindowOpen etc.). fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `triggers[].event`, with `eventId` beside it. |
| parseFileMetadata | attr:'enable' | gap | catalog-file-metadata | enable on HideToolbars / HideWebDirectSharing / HideClientSharing. `hideToolbars` is reported by `read:fileOptions`; the two host-list sharing flags are not. |
| parseFileMetadata | attr:'keychain' | covered | — | SavePassword keychain flag (File Options > log in using). fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `allowStoredCredentials`. |
| parseFileMetadata | attr:'name' | covered | — | Names the startup LayoutReference and each file-trigger ScriptReference. fm 0.8.0 reports both bindings: `read:fileOptions` `layout` `{name,id}` and `triggers[].script` with `scriptId`. |
| parseFileMetadata | attr:'type' | covered | — | Encryption type (0/1) and Login type (-1/0/1). Encryption via `evaluate:calculation` `Get ( EncryptionState )`; the login type is `read:fileOptions` `login.mode`. |
| parseFileMetadata | attr:'version' | covered | — | Minimum version the file requires. fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `minimumVersion` (value and build). |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'Encryption' | covered | evaluate:calculation `Get ( EncryptionState )` (value "0"/"1") | Encryption-at-rest state. No file catalog, but the Get() function evaluates against the file (verified on ooe 2026-09-14: "0"). The encryption hint and shared-ID details are not exposed. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'HideClientSharing' | gap | catalog-file-metadata | File Options checkbox. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'HideToolbars' | covered | — | File Options checkbox. fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `hideToolbars`. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'HideWebDirectSharing' | gap | catalog-file-metadata | File Options checkbox. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'LayoutReference' | covered | — | The startup layout binding under Metadata. fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `layout` with `name` and `id`. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'Login' | covered | — | File Options login mode. fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `login.mode`. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'Metadata' | gap | catalog-file-metadata | Root of the whole File Options block. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'Minimum' | covered | — | Minimum FileMaker version element. fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `minimumVersion`. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'SavePassword' | covered | — | File Options save-password element. fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `allowStoredCredentials`. |
| parseFileMetadata | qs:'ScriptReference' | covered | — | Script bound to a file-level trigger. fm 0.8.0 reports it as `read:fileOptions` `triggers[].script` with `scriptId` and `scriptName`. |
| parseFileMetadata | qsa:'ScriptTrigger' | covered | — | The list of file-level script triggers; drives s.fileMeta.file_triggers. fm 0.8.0 reports them as `read:fileOptions` `triggers[]` with event, eventId, script, scriptId, scriptName. |
| parseLibrary | qs:'LibraryCatalog' | dropped | owner ruling 2026-09-14 | The image/binary library (button icons, pictures). Not relevant to the analysis; layout objects still name their icon or picture by id. |
| parseLibrary | qsa:'BinaryData' | dropped | owner ruling 2026-09-14 | Binary payload count for the old file-weight stat. Not relevant. |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'absolute' | covered | baseDirectory.relative | BaseDirectoryReference absolute on a container's external-storage path; fm reports the inverse boolean on read:baseDirectory, with field.options.container.baseDirectory naming which one. |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'comment' | covered | table.description + field.options.comment | Table comment needs a read:table describe (by name); the listing carries only name/id. |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'datatype' | covered | field.type | Text/Number/Date/Time/Timestamp/Container; fm uses lowercase words for the same set. |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'existing' | covered | field.options.validation.existingValue |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'fieldtype' | covered | field.options.fieldType | Normal/Calculated/Summary. Needs detail:true on the read:field listing. |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'global' | covered | field.options.global |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'id' | covered | table.id + field.id |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'index' | covered | field.options.indexing | Plus field.options.autoIndex and field.options.indexLanguage. |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'maxRepetitions' | covered | field.options.repetitions |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'name' | covered | table.name + field.name + baseDirectory.path |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'notEmpty' | covered | field.options.validation.notEmpty |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'prohibitModification' | covered | field.options.autoEnter.prohibitModification |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'storeCalculationResults' | covered | field.options.stored | Stored vs unstored calc; combine with field.options.global the same way the legacy does. |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'type' | covered | field.options.autoEnter.type + field.options.container.encrypted | AutoEnter type maps 1:1 (serial/calculated/lookup/creation*/modification*); Remote type Secure/Open maps to container.encrypted. |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'unique' | covered | field.options.validation.unique |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | attr:'withFewerFolders' | covered | field.options.container.fewerFolders | Verified on ooe 2026-09-14 (table containers, field encrypted_with_fewer_folders): field.options.container reports external, encrypted, fewerFolders and baseDirectory. Reported only for a secure-storage container. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > AutoEnter' | covered | field.options.autoEnter |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > BaseDirectoryReference' | covered | field.options.container.baseDirectory |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > BaseTableReference' | covered | field.table | read:field items carry table{name,id}. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > Calculation' | covered | field.options.calculation.text | Calc-field body. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > ObjectList' | covered | field.items[] | Structural wrapper; fm returns the field array directly. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > Remote' | covered | field.options.container.external |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > Storage' | covered | field.options.{global,stored,indexing,repetitions} |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > Text' | covered | field.options.calculation.text | The CDATA formula inside Calculation; fm returns the same text. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:':scope > Validation' | covered | field.options.validation |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:'BaseTableCatalog' | covered | read:table listing |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:'BaseTableReference' | covered | field.table.name |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:'Calculation' | covered | field.options.validation.calculation.text |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:'FieldsForTables' | covered | read:field {table} per table | Structural; the legacy second pass exists only because SaXML splits definitions from per-table field lists. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:'InRange' | covered | field.options.validation.range.{min,max} |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:'Looked_up' | covered | field.options.autoEnter.lookup | With source.occurrence, source.field, onNoMatch, copyIfSourceEmpty. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:'ObjectList' | covered | field.items[] | Structural. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qs:'TableOccurrenceReference' | covered | field.table.name | Resolves which table a FieldCatalog belongs to; fm addresses read:field by table. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qsa:':scope > BaseTable' | covered | read:table items[] |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qsa:':scope > FieldCatalog' | covered | read:field {table} per table | Structural. |
| parseTablesAndFields | qsa:':scope > Field[fieldtype]' | covered | read:field items[] |  |
| parseTablesAndFields | qsa:'FieldCatalog' | covered | read:field {table} per table | Structural. |
| parseRelationships | attr:'baseTable' | covered | tableOccurrence.table.name | Legacy fallback attribute for a TO with no relationships. |
| parseRelationships | attr:'blue' | covered | tableOccurrence.graph.color | fm returns one colour string instead of red/green/blue integers; the to_colors tally works the same on it. |
| parseRelationships | attr:'cascadeCreate' | covered | relation.leftToRight.createRelated + relation.rightToLeft.createRelated |  |
| parseRelationships | attr:'cascadeDelete' | covered | relation.leftToRight.cascadeDelete + relation.rightToLeft.cascadeDelete |  |
| parseRelationships | attr:'green' | covered | tableOccurrence.graph.color | See attr:'blue'. |
| parseRelationships | attr:'id' | covered | tableOccurrence.id + relation.id |  |
| parseRelationships | attr:'name' | covered | tableOccurrence.name + relation.left.name + relation.right.name |  |
| parseRelationships | attr:'red' | covered | tableOccurrence.graph.color | See attr:'blue'. |
| parseRelationships | attr:'table' | covered | tableOccurrence.table.name |  |
| parseRelationships | attr:'type' | covered | relation.predicates[].op | Equal/NotEqual/Greater/Less/GreaterOrEqual/LessOrEqual; fm uses its own operator words for the same six. |
| parseRelationships | qs:':scope > LeftTable' | covered | relation.left + relation.leftToRight |  |
| parseRelationships | qs:':scope > RightTable' | covered | relation.right + relation.rightToLeft |  |
| parseRelationships | qs:'BaseTableReference' | covered | tableOccurrence.table |  |
| parseRelationships | qs:'Color' | covered | tableOccurrence.graph.color | Needs a read:tableOccurrence describe; the listing has no graph block. |
| parseRelationships | qs:'LeftField > FieldReference' | covered | relation.predicates[].leftField |  |
| parseRelationships | qs:'RelationshipCatalog' | covered | read:relation listing |  |
| parseRelationships | qs:'RightField > FieldReference' | covered | relation.predicates[].rightField |  |
| parseRelationships | qs:'SortSpecification' | covered | relation.rightToLeft.sortSpec.fields[]{field,order} | The relationship's stored sort order. fm 0.7.0 reports the sort on whichever side sorts: `leftToRight.sortSpec` / `rightToLeft.sortSpec` appear when that side's `sortRelated` is true, with `fields[].field` naming each sort field, `fields[].order` its direction, and the length of `fields[]` giving the number of sort fields. "Put blanks last" and "keep records sorted" (`maintain`) are still unreported; they stay on the register's `relation` entry. |
| parseRelationships | qs:'TableOccurrenceCatalog' | covered | read:tableOccurrence listing |  |
| parseRelationships | qs:'TableOccurrenceReference' | covered | relation.left.name + relation.right.name |  |
| parseRelationships | qsa:':scope > Relationship' | covered | read:relation items[] |  |
| parseRelationships | qsa:':scope > TableOccurrence' | covered | read:tableOccurrence items[] |  |
| parseRelationships | qsa:'JoinPredicate' | covered | relation.predicates[] |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'Display' | covered | layout.theme.displayName | LayoutThemeReference Display, the human-readable theme name; drives s.layouts.theme_layout_map. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'Style' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].control | Field Display Style 0-5 maps to fm's control word (editBox, dropDownList, popupMenu, radioButtonSet, checkboxSet, dropDownCalendar). |
| parseLayouts | attr:'allowFormView' | covered | layout.viewStyles.enabled.form |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'allowListView' | covered | layout.viewStyles.enabled.list |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'allowTableView' | covered | layout.viewStyles.enabled.table |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'defaultView' | covered | layout.viewStyles.default |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'displayName' | gap | catalog-object-styles | LocalCSS displayName. layout.contents.objects[].style gives the named style's display name, but an object whose LocalCSS carries CSS text and no style name (the local-override case this parser counts) is invisible to fm. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'enable' | derived | derived from layout.contents.objects[].action | buttons_single_step. fm models a button action as exactly one step object (action.step/stepID) or a script call, so the enabled-step tally collapses to whether action is present. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'hidden' | covered | layout.hidden | Options hidden=True means the layout is hidden from the Layouts menu. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'id' | covered | layout.id + layout.contents.objects[].id |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'isFolder' | covered | layout.type | fm reports type 'folder' vs 'layout' in both tree and flatten modes. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'left' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].bounds.left |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'name' | covered | layout.name + layout.contents.objects[].name + layout.tableOccurrence.name |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'quickFind' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].quickFind | Object-level Quick Find. The layout-level Quick Find option is layout.flags.set "disableQuickFind" (bit 15, 0x8000; set when quick find is off). |
| parseLayouts | attr:'right' | derived | derived from layout.contents.objects[].bounds.left + bounds.width | fm reports width, not a right edge; objects_outside_bounds compares left+width against geometry.baseWidth. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'rowLimit' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].rows | Portal row count. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'rowsperpage' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].rows | Alternate spelling of the same portal row count. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'saveRecord' | covered | layout.flags.set contains "confirmRecordSave" (bit 4, 0x10) | Layout Setup > General > Save record changes automatically. fm's own layout flag table (34 names, register Task 6) names the bit confirmRecordSave: set when the confirmation dialog is asked for, i.e. auto-save off. Not exercised on the reference layouts (bit clear on all), reported when set. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'show' | gap | catalog-portal-setup | Portal Options show bitmask. Bit 2 (allow delete) is covered by layout.contents.objects[].allowDelete; bits 1 (allow create), 8 (sorted) and 16 (filtered) have no fm key - confirmed by the layout describe notes, which say the portal's sort and filter are reported nowhere. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'startrow' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].initialRow |  |
| parseLayouts | attr:'type' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].type | 19 object type words cover every LayoutObject type the legacy counts. The Part type reading of this same attribute is a gap, registered on qs:':scope > PartsList'. |
| parseLayouts | attr:'width' | covered | layout.geometry.baseWidth |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > Button' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].type = button + .action |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > Field' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].field |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > LayoutThemeReference' | covered | layout.theme |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > LocalCSS' | gap | catalog-object-styles | The per-object local CSS override text and its property count (s.layouts.objects_with_local_css, local_css_node_count, local_css_objects). fm reports only the named style under objects[].style. |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > MenuSetReference' | gap | catalog-layout-menuset | Which custom menu set a layout installs. read:customMenuSet lists the sets and read:layout describes the layout, but no key joins them. |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > Options' | covered | layout.viewStyles + layout.hidden + layout.flags | saveRecord and the layout-level quickFind inside this element are flags.set names confirmRecordSave and disableQuickFind (fm's 34-name layout flag table). |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > PartsList' | covered | layout.parts[]{type,height,offset,name,breakField} | Layout part bands. fm 0.7.0 reports them at the layout's top level rather than inside `contents.objects[]`: one entry per part, `type` one of titleHeader, header, leadingGrandSummary, leadingSubSummary, body, trailingSubSummary, trailingGrandSummary, footer, titleFooter, topNavigation, bottomNavigation, plus `height`, `offset`, `name` and, on a sub-summary, `breakField{name,id,tableOccurrence{id,name}}`. Part presence, count, order and geometry all come from this array; the options word does not (catalog-layout-parts). |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > Portal' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].type = portal |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > ScriptTriggers' | covered | layout.scriptTriggers[] + layout.contents.objects[].scriptTriggers[] | Layout describe also gives scriptTriggerCount directly. The object-level key is present on 206 of 473 objects in the samples — absent on object kinds that cannot hold a trigger, `[]` when a kind can and has none — so consumers must guard for its absence rather than assume it is always there. |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > Table' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].tableOccurrence | The portal's table occurrence. |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > TableOccurrenceReference' | covered | layout.tableOccurrence | Present on the listing as well as the describe. |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > Theme' | covered | layout.theme |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > Usage' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].quickFind + browseEntry + findEntry |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:':scope > action' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].action |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:'Bounds' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].bounds | left/top/width/height on every object at every nesting depth. |
| parseLayouts | qs:'ButtonBar > ObjectList' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].objects[] on a buttonBar | Segments are nested button objects; button_bar_segments is their length. |
| parseLayouts | qs:'CustomMenuSetReference' | gap | catalog-layout-menuset | Alternate tag for the same layout-to-menu-set binding. |
| parseLayouts | qs:'Display' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].control | See attr:'Style'. |
| parseLayouts | qs:'IconData' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].iconId | Absent on a button with no icon, which is exactly the buttons_with_icon test. The icon image itself is not readable: catalog-library. |
| parseLayouts | qs:'LayoutCatalog' | covered | read:layout {flatten:true} listing |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:'ScriptReference' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].action.script |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:'SlideControl > ObjectList' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].objects[] on a slideControl |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:'Step' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].action.step | Single-step button actions report step, stepID and the step's own option keys. |
| parseLayouts | qs:'TabControl > ObjectList' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].objects[] on a tabControl |  |
| parseLayouts | qs:'ThemeReference' | covered | layout.theme |  |
| parseLayouts | qsa:'LayoutCatalog ScriptReference' | derived | derived from layout.contents.objects[].action.script + layout.scriptTriggers[].script | s.layouts.script_refs_from_layouts is the count of both across every layout. |
| parseLayouts | qsa:'LayoutObject' | covered | layout.contents.objects[] (recursive) | Nested objects appear under objects[] on group, portal, popover, tabControl/tabPanel, slideControl/slidePanel and buttonBar. |
| parseLayouts | qsa:'Metadata ScriptTrigger' | covered | — | The FILE's own script triggers (File Options: OnFirstWindowOpen, OnLastWindowClose, OnWindowOpen, OnWindowClose...), which SaXML stores under Metadata, not under any layout. The legacy Layouts tab counted them a second time to show a file-triggers figure beside the layout trigger counts. fm 0.8.0 now reports file-level triggers as `read:fileOptions` `triggers[]`; layout-level and object-level triggers are fully covered by read:layout. |
| parseLayouts | qsa:'Step' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].action |  |
| parseScripts | attr:'enable' | covered | script.body[].disabled | Inverse sense: fm reports disabled true where SaXML says enable=False, and the key is absent on an enabled step. |
| parseScripts | attr:'hidden' | covered | script.hidden | hidden=False in SaXML means 'include in menu'; fm reports the boolean directly on both listing and describe. |
| parseScripts | attr:'id' | covered | script.id + script.body[].stepID |  |
| parseScripts | attr:'isFolder' | covered | script.type | folder / script / separator. |
| parseScripts | attr:'name' | covered | script.name + script.body[].step |  |
| parseScripts | attr:'runwithfullaccess' | covered | script.runWithFullAccess | Describe only; the listing does not carry it. |
| parseScripts | qs:':scope > Calculation' | covered | script.body[].parameter | Presence of a parameter on Perform Script / PSoS, for perform_script_with_param. |
| parseScripts | qs:':scope > FileReference' | covered | script.body[].file | Distinguishes a genuine cross-file call from a dangling in-file script reference in the call graph. |
| parseScripts | qs:':scope > Options' | covered | script.runWithFullAccess + script.hidden |  |
| parseScripts | qs:':scope > ScriptReference' | covered | script.name + script.body[].script |  |
| parseScripts | qs:'ObjectList' | covered | script.body[] | Structural. |
| parseScripts | qs:'ScriptCatalog' | covered | read:script {flatten:true} listing |  |
| parseScripts | qs:'ScriptReference' | covered | script.body[].script | Callee name for the call graph. |
| parseScripts | qs:'StepsForScripts' | covered | read:script {id} describe | fm needs one describe per script to get body[]; the listing gives only steps as a count. |
| parseScripts | qsa:':scope > Script' | covered | read:script items[] |  |
| parseScripts | qsa:':scope > Step' | covered | script.body[] | Also gives block{role,start,end}, which replaces the legacy's own If/Loop balance counting. |
| parseScripts | qsa:'Calculation' | covered | script.body[] calculation-valued keys | value, condition, parameter, calculation, name and slots.calc.* carry the formula text the $$-scan reads. |
| parseValueLists | attr:'UUID' | derived | derived from layout.contents.objects[].valueList.{id,name} + field.options.validation.valueList | fm gives value lists no UUID; the reference tally joins on id/name instead. |
| parseValueLists | attr:'id' | covered | valueList.id |  |
| parseValueLists | attr:'name' | covered | valueList.name |  |
| parseValueLists | attr:'type' | covered | valueList.type | Source type attribute; fm's type word carries the same custom / fromField / fromFile distinction. |
| parseValueLists | attr:'value' | covered | valueList.type | Source value attribute (Custom / FromField). |
| parseValueLists | qs:':scope > Field' | covered | valueList.field | With field.occurrence and field.field. |
| parseValueLists | qs:':scope > PrimaryField > FieldReference' | covered | valueList.field.{occurrence,field} |  |
| parseValueLists | qs:':scope > Source' | covered | valueList.type |  |
| parseValueLists | qs:':scope > UUID' | derived | derived from valueList.id + valueList.name | The value list's own UUID is only the join key for the reference tally; fm joins by id/name. |
| parseValueLists | qs:'OptionsForValueLists' | covered | valueList.options | showRelatedOnly, showSecondFieldOnly, sortBySecondField. |
| parseValueLists | qs:'PrimaryField' | covered | valueList.field |  |
| parseValueLists | qs:'ShowRelated' | covered | valueList.options.showRelatedOnly | Plus valueList.startTable, which names the relationship start. |
| parseValueLists | qs:'Source' | covered | valueList.type |  |
| parseValueLists | qs:'TableOccurrenceReference' | covered | valueList.field.occurrence |  |
| parseValueLists | qs:'ValueListCatalog' | covered | read:valueList listing |  |
| parseValueLists | qsa:':scope > ValueList' | covered | read:valueList items[] |  |
| parseValueLists | qsa:'Value' | covered | valueList.values[] | Custom-values list; item count is values.length. |
| parseValueLists | qsa:'ValueList' | covered | read:valueList items[] |  |
| parseValueLists | qsa:'ValueListReference[UUID]' | derived | derived from layout.contents.objects[].valueList + field.options.validation.valueList | s.valueLists per-list refs count; fm surfaces every value-list reference on the object or field that makes it. |
| parseAccounts | attr:'Export' | covered | privilegeSet.fileOptions.exportAllowed |  |
| parseAccounts | attr:'Print' | covered | privilegeSet.fileOptions.printAllowed |  |
| parseAccounts | attr:'allowOverride' | covered | privilegeSet.fileOptions.dataEntryOverride |  |
| parseAccounts | attr:'commands' | covered | privilegeSet.fileOptions.menuCommands | commands='Minimal' is one of the words fm reports here. |
| parseAccounts | attr:'disconnectIdle' | covered | privilegeSet.fileOptions.noIdleDisconnect | Inverse sense: disconnectIdle=True corresponds to noIdleDisconnect false. |
| parseAccounts | attr:'enable' | covered | account.enabled | Describe only; the listing carries name/id/builtIn. |
| parseAccounts | attr:'id' | covered | account.id + privilegeSet.id + extendedPrivilege.id |  |
| parseAccounts | attr:'manageDatabase' | covered | privilegeSet.fileOptions.canManageDatabase |  |
| parseAccounts | attr:'membercount' | derived | derived from read:privilegeSet listing total | Legacy fallback when the catalog lists no members; fm's listing reports total and returned. |
| parseAccounts | attr:'name' | covered | account.name + privilegeSet.name + extendedPrivilege.name | fm reports account names even where the SaXML export omits them, so s.accounts.acc.names_hidden becomes moot. |
| parseAccounts | attr:'type' | covered | account.userType | FileMaker / OAuth / ExternalServer. |
| parseAccounts | qs:':scope > ObjectList' | covered | items[] on the listing | Structural. |
| parseAccounts | qs:'AccountsCatalog' | covered | read:account listing |  |
| parseAccounts | qs:'Authentication' | covered | account.hasPassword |  |
| parseAccounts | qs:'ExtendedPrivilegesCatalog' | covered | read:extendedPrivilege listing |  |
| parseAccounts | qs:'Other' | covered | privilegeSet.fileOptions | The whole Other attribute block maps onto fileOptions. |
| parseAccounts | qs:'PasswordEncrypted' | gap | catalog-modification-info | Whether an account carries a password. fm 0.6.0's account.hasPassword does NOT track it: it equals (userType == fileMakerUser) on all 13 Ooe accounts (account 14 has no PasswordEncrypted yet reads true; the seven external/OAuth accounts carry one and read false). Register: account:* "password set" gap (Task 11); the blank-password observation cannot be built on hasPassword. Gap id kept under catalog-modification-info pending a dedicated id in the register. |
| parseAccounts | qs:'PrivilegeSetReference' | covered | account.privilegeSet |  |
| parseAccounts | qs:'PrivilegeSetsCatalog' | covered | read:privilegeSet listing |  |
| parseAccounts | qsa:':scope > Account' | covered | read:account items[] |  |
| parseAccounts | qsa:':scope > ExtendedPrivilege' | covered | read:extendedPrivilege items[] |  |
| parseAccounts | qsa:':scope > PrivilegeSet' | covered | read:privilegeSet items[] |  |
| parseAccounts | qsa:'PrivilegeSetReference' | covered | extendedPrivilege.privilegeSets[] | Per-extended-privilege set count; needs a read:extendedPrivilege describe by id, which the listing does not carry. |
| parseCustomFunctions | attr:'id' | covered | customFunction.id |  |
| parseCustomFunctions | attr:'name' | covered | customFunction.name |  |
| parseCustomFunctions | qs:'CustomFunctionsCatalog' | covered | read:customFunction listing |  |
| parseCustomFunctions | qs:'Display' | covered | customFunction.prototype | The signature string. fm also reports arity and parameters[] directly, so the legacy's split-on-semicolon param count is no longer needed. |
| parseCustomFunctions | qs:'ObjectList' | covered | read:customFunction items[] | Structural. |
| parseCustomFunctions | qsa:':scope > CustomFunction' | covered | read:customFunction items[] | The listing is a tree; type discriminates customFunction from folder. |
| parseCustomFunctions | qsa:'CalcsForCustomFunctions CustomFunction' | covered | customFunction.body | Recursion detection is the same substring test on this text. |

| parseBrokenReferences | attr:'id' | covered | field.options.autoEnter.lookup.source + script.problems[] + tableOccurrence.table.resolved | The legacy uses id=0 / empty name as the dangle marker; fm resolves references by name and flags the broken ones in script.problems[] and table.resolved. |
| parseBrokenReferences | attr:'name' | covered | table.name + field.name + script.name + layout.name + valueList.name | Names the parent of each finding. |
| parseBrokenReferences | attr:'type' | covered | field.options.autoEnter.type + valueList.type |  |

| parseBrokenReferences | qs:'StepsForScripts' | covered | read:script {id} describe | fm also reports script.problems[], its own live re-check of unresolved field, layout, script and calculation references - a stronger signal than the <Field Missing> string scan. |

| parseBrokenReferences | qsa:'CalcsForCustomFunctions CustomFunction' | covered | customFunction.body |  |
| parseBrokenReferences | qsa:'Calculation' | covered | calculation-valued keys across field, script.body[], layout objects and customFunction.body | fm returns FileMaker's own <Field Missing> / <Table Missing> tokens inside the text, so the same substring count works. |
| parseBrokenReferences | qsa:'Conditions > Formatting' | gap | catalog-conditional-formatting | The conditional-formatting block on a layout object. |
| parseBrokenReferences | qsa:'Conditions > Hide' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].hideCondition | Reported as the calculation text, so the marker scan is unchanged. |

| parseBrokenReferences | qsa:'Tooltip' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].tooltip | Reported as the calculation text. |
| parseGlobalVars | attr:'value' | covered | script.body[].name | The Set Variable target name, including names containing spaces. |
| parseGlobalVars | qsa:'Chunk[type="VariableReference"]' | gap | catalog-calculation-tokens | FileMaker's own parse of each calculation (the FM 2026 DDR_INFO chunk list) names every $$ variable a formula reads. fm 0.8.0 reports field and custom-function tokens via `validate:calculation` `references`, but does not report variable tokens. So the global-variables tab must find $$ names by scanning text, which is approximate for names with spaces ($$SMTP Server, valid in FileMaker), names inside comments, and names inside string literals. |
| parseGlobalVars | qsa:'StepsForScripts Parameter[type="Variable"] > Name[value]' | covered | script.body[].name | Set Variable targets; confirmed on step 141 in the samples. |

| parseCustomMenus | qsa:':scope > CustomMenu' | covered | read:customMenu items[] |  |
| parseCustomMenus | qsa:':scope > CustomMenuSet' | covered | read:customMenuSet items[] |  |
| parseThemeStyleCss | qsa:'CSS' | covered | `read:theme` describe `css` | The theme's whole stylesheet. fm 0.7.0's theme describe returns the same text the SaXML CDATA carried, as one `css` string, so every per-style colour, font, border and fill in the Themes tab still has to be parsed out of the CSS text exactly as the legacy parsed it out of the CDATA. |
| parseThemes | attr:'custom' | covered | `read:theme` describe `isCustom` | Marks a theme as developer-made rather than shipped. fm also reports `isDefault` and `isDeprecated` alongside it. |
| parseThemes | attr:'isCustom' | covered | `read:theme` describe `isCustom` | Alternate spelling of the same flag; one fm key answers both. |
| parseThemes | attr:'name' | covered | `read:theme` describe `name` | The theme's internal id. `read:theme` lists every theme defined in the file, so a theme no layout wears is visible now; `layout.theme.{id,name,displayName,group}` still names the theme each layout wears. |
| parseThemes | qs:':scope > Display' | covered | `read:theme` describe `displayName` | The theme's human-readable name; `group` names the family it is filed under. |
| parseThemes | qs:'Display' | covered | `read:theme` describe `displayName` | Fallback selector for the same name. |
| parseThemes | qs:'Metadata' | covered | `read:theme` describe `namedStyleNames` + `colorPalette.swatch1..5` | Structural wrapper that held the theme's namedstyles list and colour elements; fm returns both as keys on the theme describe. The metadata this element also carried that fm does not report - base theme name and version, locale, platform, theme version, chart colour scheme, the 24 layout-builder metrics, the tag list and modification who/when - stays on the register's `theme` entry. |
| parseThemes | qs:'ThemeCatalog' | covered | `read:theme` list `items[]` | The list of themes defined in the file. |
| parseThemes | qs:'namedstyles' | covered | `read:theme` describe `namedStyleNames` | The per-theme style list: one key per named style, its value the style's display name. style_count and the unused-style detection both read it. On ooe fm returns 94 of the 95 style keys the legacy finds; the 95th is defined on the second theme only. |
| parseThemes | qsa:':scope > Theme' | covered | `read:theme` list `items[]` | Iterating the themes; fm returns the array, then a describe per theme. |
| parseThemes | qsa:'color,Color' | covered | `read:theme` describe `colorPalette.swatch1..5` | The theme palette, five swatches. The colours individual styles use are inside the `css` text, not broken out as keys. |
| parseExternalSources | attr:'direction' | covered | authorization.type | inbound / outbound. |
| parseExternalSources | attr:'driver' | covered | externalDataSource.dsn (DSN, not the ODBC driver name) | fm reports the ODBC data source name, not the driver; sourceType 'odbc' still names the kind. |

| parsePlugins | attr:'type' | gap | catalog-plugins | Chunk type ExternalFunctionRef / PluginFunction / PluginFunctionRef, which is how a plugin call is told apart from a native function. |
| parsePlugins | qsa:'Chunk' | gap | catalog-plugins | The DDR chunk stream the whole plugin tab is built from. Plugin call sites survive as raw text inside calculations, but nothing marks them as plugin calls, so the native-function mistagging list and the per-sub-function call tally both lose their source. |
| parseTags | attr:'isFolder' | covered | layout.type + script.type |  |
| parseTags | qs:':scope > ObjectList' | covered | items[] on each listing | Structural. |
| parseTags | qs:':scope > TagList' | gap | catalog-tags | fm reports tags on fields (options.tags), table occurrences, custom menus and custom menu sets, but not on layouts or scripts. s.tags.tagged_layouts and tagged_scripts, and their share of tag_counts, have no source. |
| parseTags | qs:'LayoutCatalog' | covered | read:layout listing |  |

| parseTags | qsa:'FieldCatalog' | covered | read:field {table} per table | Structural. |
| parseTags | qsa:'Layout' | covered | read:layout items[] | Iteration is covered; the TagList read on each layout is the gap (catalog-tags). |
| parseTags | qsa:'Script' | covered | read:script items[] | Iteration is covered; the TagList read on each script is the gap (catalog-tags). |
| parseModifications | attr:'Display' | covered | layout.theme.displayName + customFunction.prototype | Fallback name for an object with no name attribute. Where that object is a Theme, `read:theme` names it (`displayName`). |
| parseModifications | attr:'modifications' | gap | catalog-modification-info | The per-object modification counter that the whole hotspots tab ranks on. Not reported for any object, layouts included - layout.modified carries who and when, never how many. The counter itself is DDR bookkeeping; the ask to Claris is the who/when triple (account, user name, timestamp) on every catalog, which fm reports for layouts only (register: catalog-modification-info). |
| parseModifications | attr:'name' | covered | the name key of each catalog | Names the modified object. |
| parseModifications | attr:'timestamp' | gap | catalog-modification-info | Last-modified timestamp. Covered for layouts only, by layout.modified.timestamp. |
| parseModifications | attr:'userName' | gap | catalog-modification-info | Last-modifying user. Covered for layouts only, by layout.modified.by / layout.modified.account. |
| parseModifications | qsa:'UUID[modifications]' | gap | catalog-modification-info | The audit element on fields, tables, layouts, scripts, TOs, themes, custom functions, custom menus, value lists and privilege sets. Only layouts have an fm equivalent (layout.modified), and it carries no count. |
| parseBitFlags | attr:'Options' | gap | catalog-layout-parts | Part Definition options word. fm 0.7.0 does report the parts themselves (`layout.parts[]{type,height,offset,name,breakField}`); what is missing is the options word behind page breaks, page numbering, alternate row state and active row state. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | attr:'inputMode' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].inputMode + keyboardType | fm reports the decoded word (automatic, roman, ...) instead of the raw option number. The raw number only mattered to the retired Bit Flags tab. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | attr:'name' | covered | layout.name | Only used as the source label on a flag row. |
| parseBitFlags | attr:'show' | gap | catalog-portal-setup | Portal 'show' bits: delete is covered by objects[].allowDelete; create, sort and filter are the portal-setup gap (fm help: sort and filter are 'reported nowhere yet'). The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | attr:'type' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].type + objects[].control | Object kind and field control style (editBox, checkboxSet, popupMenu, ...) are both named keys. Part types are `layout.parts[].type`; only the raw part type code is still unreported (catalog-layout-parts). The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qs:':scope > Field' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].{field, control, browseEntry, findEntry, exitOnTab, exitOnReturn, exitOnEnter, selectContentsOnEntry, autoComplete, ...} | Every field-object option word is decoded into named keys (about 45 on a field object). The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qs:':scope > Options' | covered | layout.flags.{raw,set} + layout.contents.objects[].<named keys> + account.{enabled,forceExpire,hasPassword} | The raw option word survives only on layouts (flags.raw beside flags.set naming 22 bits); everywhere else fm reports the decoded keys and not the number. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qs:':scope > Portal' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].{allowDelete, rows, initialRow, allowVerticalScrolling, scrollBarVisibility, resetScrollBarOnExit} | Portal option words decoded; create/sort/filter are catalog-portal-setup. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qs:':scope > Usage' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].{control, inputMode, keyboardType, repetitionCount, repetitionOrientation} | Field Usage word decoded into named keys. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qs:'AccountsCatalog' | covered | account.{enabled, forceExpire, hasPassword, userType, privilegeSet} | The catalog-level options word is not reported, but each account's attributes are decoded; the word's own meaning was never documented. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qs:'Definition' | gap | catalog-layout-parts | Part Definition: options word and part type. The part type is `layout.parts[].type` now; the definition kind and the options word are not reported. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qs:'LayoutCatalog' | covered | read:layout (flatten) + layout.flags | Entry point for the layout flag group; layout.flags.set names 22 bits and flags.raw carries the word. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qsa:'Layout' | covered | layout.flags.{raw,set} | Per-layout options word, decoded and raw. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qsa:'LayoutObject' | covered | layout.contents.objects[].<named keys> | Per-object options word decoded into named keys (locked, hideWhenPrinting, slideLeft, slideUp, resizeEnclosingPart, applyInFindMode and the kind-specific ones). The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |
| parseBitFlags | qsa:'Part' | gap | catalog-layout-parts | Per-part options word. The parts are reported (`layout.parts[]`), the options word is not. The Bit Flags tab is retired: it catalogued raw option words because SaXML leaves them undecoded; fm reports every option as a named key, so there is nothing to decipher. |

The new inspector reports one merged `unbalanced` count over every block role rather than one per opener type, by design: the finding is that fm could not close a block, and which keyword opened it is on the step. |

## Summary

| Classification | Rows |
|---|---|
| covered | 432 |
| derived | 67 |
| gap | 56 |
| dropped | 8 |

Counted from this file on 2026-09-22 by tallying the Classification column of every table row; 432 + 67 + 56 + 8 = 563, the number of rows in the table. The rows themselves have not moved since 2026-09-14; what changed is that fm 0.7.0 turned 27 gap rows into covered or derived rows (the theme count is derived from the listing total, like every other count) - all 23 of `catalog-theme-styles`, the one `catalog-relation-sort` row, and three of the seven `catalog-layout-parts` rows - and then fm 0.8.0-beta.0's `read:fileOptions` turned 19 more gap rows into covered ones, leaving the two host-list sharing flags, the saved page setup, the Browse-mode trigger flag and the `Metadata` container. A plain `grep -c` over the whole file returns one more than each number here, because the Summary row above also matches.

## Gap ids introduced

Ten ids, after fm 0.7.0 closed `catalog-theme-styles` and `catalog-relation-sort` outright and narrowed `catalog-layout-parts` (2026-09-16).

From the brief's list:

- `catalog-file-metadata` (5 rows): fm 0.8.0 reports most File Options settings via `read:fileOptions`: the startup layout, login mode, toolbar flag, minimum version, stored credentials flag, and all file script triggers with their events and scripts. What remains a gap: the two "hide from host's file list" flags (FileMaker clients and WebDirect), the saved page setup (orientation, scale, paper size), whether a file trigger is enabled in Browse mode, and the structural container element `Metadata`. Encryption state, file name, path, size, persistent ID and locale remain readable through evaluate:calculation with Get() functions.
- `catalog-calculation-tokens` (4 rows): FileMaker's tokenised form of every calculation. A FileMaker 2026 SaXML export with DDR info carries each formula twice: as text and as FileMaker's own parse of it, a list of Chunk elements typed FieldReference, VariableReference, FunctionRef, CustomFunctionRef, ScriptRef and so on, which says exactly what a formula references. fm 0.8.0 reports field and custom-function tokens via `validate:calculation` `references`, but not variable tokens. Every cross-reference analysis (unreferenced fields and occurrences, broken references, global variables, custom function usage) therefore has to scan calculation text for variable reads, which is approximate where FileMaker's parser is exact: variable names with spaces, references inside comments or string literals, `::` inside quoted text.
- `catalog-plugins` (7 rows): nothing marks a calculation call site as a plugin function call. The Plugins tab and the plugin-call uncertainty signal behind the Fields confidence tier depend on it.
- `catalog-modification-info` (14 rows): no object reports a modification count, and only a layout reports who and when (`layout.modified`). The Modification Hotspots tab and the audit columns of the Persistent Data tab depend on it.
- `catalog-layout-parts` (4 rows, narrowed on 2026-09-16): fm 0.7.0 reports `layout.parts[]{type,height,offset,name,breakField}`, which covers part presence, count, type, order and geometry, so the Wireframe tab and the header/footer/sub-summary/navigation layout lists have a source now. What is left is the part's options word (page breaks, page numbering, alternate and active row state), the raw part type code, the part definition kind, the object count per part, and any style or CSS a part wears - a part entry carries no style key at all.
- `catalog-object-styles` (4 rows): an object's local CSS override. `objects[].style` gives the named style's display name, but an object carrying CSS text and no style name - the exact local-override case the legacy counts - is invisible.

New in this pass:

- `catalog-tags` (8 rows): fm reports tags on fields, table occurrences, custom menus and custom menu sets, but not on layouts or scripts. The Tags tab's `tagged_layouts` and `tagged_scripts`, and their share of every tag total, have no source.
- `catalog-portal-setup` (4 rows): the portal's filter calculation, its stored sort order and its allow-create bit. The layout describe notes state outright that the sort and the filter are reported nowhere. `portals_with_filter`, `portals_with_sort` and `portals_allow_create` depend on them, and a field referenced only from a portal filter becomes a false positive in the unreferenced-fields report.
- `catalog-conditional-formatting` (3 rows): no layout object key reports conditional formatting at all. The broken-reference scan over conditional-format calculations, and any field referenced only from one, depend on it.
- `catalog-layout-menuset` (2 rows): which custom menu set a layout installs. `read:customMenuSet` lists the sets and `read:layout` describes the layout, but no key joins them.
