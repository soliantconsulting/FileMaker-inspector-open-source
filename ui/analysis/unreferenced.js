// ui/analysis/unreferenced.js
// What nothing in the solution names -- fields, tables, occurrences, scripts,
// layouts, value lists, custom functions and named styles -- with how far the
// answer can be trusted.
//
// It is a filter over `references(solution)`: a catalog object is unreferenced
// when no reference of its kind resolves to it. Two rules shape the answer:
//
//   * an object never references ITSELF. A script that only calls itself, a
//     calculation field that only names itself, a recursive custom function are
//     all still unused; a self-call is not a user of the thing.
//   * a field belongs to a TABLE, not to an occurrence. `TO1::A` and `TO2::A`
//     are the same field, so one use through any occurrence of the table is a
//     use of the field.
//
// Two tiers say how strong a claim each row is, because what a developer does
// with this list is delete:
//   fields       `none` nothing names it at all; `text-only` the only thing
//                naming it is the tokeniser's reading of calculation text --
//                real evidence, but from the same reader that cannot follow an
//                indirection, so a human should look before deleting.
//   occurrences  `completely-unused` nothing names it; `relationship-only`
//                only relations do -- it is in the graph, but nothing reads or
//                writes through it.
//
// A third rule: an occurrence's fields are the SOURCE file's. `Inv_Remote::X`
// on an occurrence whose `table.dataSource` is external is a field of the file
// that source opens, whatever the occurrence is called here -- and when no file
// in the read answers that source, the field is not judged at all. Not judged
// means one field of one TABLE: the occurrence declares the base table it
// reads, so the suppression is keyed on `target + table + field`, never on the
// bare field name, which would take a second table's identically named field
// down with it (see `unjudgeable`).
//
// `confidence` qualifies the WHOLE list: `high` when every reference path this
// tool knows was readable and nothing in the file names an object at run time;
// `medium` when something does (Evaluate, GetField, a constructed ExecuteSQL, a
// script or layout named by calculation, an external source only the running
// file can resolve), so a listed object may still be used by code no static
// reader can follow; `low` when a read FAILED -- an unread listing or describe,
// a file that could not be opened -- because then the list is a claim about the
// read, not about the file, and another run could answer differently.
//
// Pure: no document, no node:, no server/. Every fm key read through access.js.
// Memoised through ui/analysis/memo.js, like every other analysis: the memo keys
// on the catalog slots a re-read swaps, not on the solution object.
