// ui/analysis/memo.js
// The one memo every derived answer of the page is cached in.
//
// The rule it exists to enforce: a memo must key on WHAT A RE-READ REPLACES,
// not on the solution object. Only a solution-grain re-read builds a new
// solution (ui/discovery.js `reread`, `kind:'solution'`); every finer grain
// mutates the solution that is already on screen:
//
//   catalog grain   `file.catalogs[c]` is swapped for a freshly staged slot, so
//                   both `slot.list` and `slot.detailById` are new objects.
//   object grain    `slot.detailById` is REPLACED, never mutated in place
//                   (ui/model.js `applyBatch`), so its identity is new and the
//                   slot's is not.
//   facts grain     `file.facts` is replaced.
//   file-options    `file.fileOptions` is replaced (ui/model.js `applyBatch`),
//                   the same as facts: one block, no list and no detailById to
//                   watch, so the slot itself is the identity.
//
// So the fingerprint is exactly those identities: for every file, `file.facts`,
// and for every catalog slot its `list` and its `detailById`, compared by `===`
// in a stable order (file target, then catalog name, both sorted). The names
// ride in the fingerprint beside the objects, so a catalog appearing or
// disappearing cannot line up by accident with the slots either side of it.
//
// A WeakMap keyed on the solution holds one entry per `compute` function, so
// two analyses of one solution never share a slot. `compute` therefore has to
// be a stable function reference -- a module-level function, which is how every
// caller uses it -- and not a closure built per call.
//
// What the fingerprint deliberately does NOT watch: anything a read never
// writes (`solution.register`, `solution.gaps`, `view` state), and the shape of
// a slot's contents. A hand-made solution mutated in place by a test without
// replacing a list or a detailById will read as unchanged; that is the same
// contract the model gives a re-read, and a test that wants a recomputation
// replaces the object the model would replace.
//
// Pure: no document, no node:, no server/. Every key read through access.js.
