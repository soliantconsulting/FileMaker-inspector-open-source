// ui/analysis/globals.js
// Every `$$` global the solution mentions: where it is set, how often it is
// mentioned at all, and in which files.
//
// A row is { name, sets: [{ target, script:{id,name}, step:{index,line,stepID} }],
// mentions, files }. `index` is the step's position in fm's `body` array;
// `line` is `index + 1`, the line number FileMaker prints beside the step, and
// is the one a page shows -- every tab and every export in this repo counts
// lines from 1. The two counts answer different questions and are read
// differently:
//
//   `sets`      every ENABLED `Set Variable` whose `name` key is a `$$` global.
//               That key is the variable the step writes -- fm gives a step no
//               name of its own (see ui/analysis/refs.js) -- so it is the one
//               place a global is definitely written. A disabled step writes
//               nothing, so it is not a set.
//   `mentions`  every `variable` reference Task 1 found with this name,
//               wherever it was written: a script step, a field's
//               auto-enter or validation, a layout object, a custom function,
//               a custom menu. The `Set Variable` target itself is one of
//               them, so `mentions === sets.length` means nothing but the sets
//               mention it -- a global written and never read. Unlike `sets`,
//               this count includes disabled steps: it is Task 1's list, and
//               Task 1 reads the whole file.
//
// A global set nowhere is still listed: a name only ever read is the more
// interesting half of the answer, and the one no catalog can confirm.
//
// FileMaker variable names are case-insensitive, so `$$Log` and `$$log` are one
// row, reported under the first spelling the read reached.
//
// Pure: no document, no node:, no server/. Every fm key read through
// get/path. Memoised through ui/analysis/memo.js, like every other analysis:
// the memo keys on the catalog slots a re-read swaps, not on the solution
// object.
