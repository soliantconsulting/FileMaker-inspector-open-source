// ui/analysis/refs.js
// Every place any object in the solution names another one, in one list.
//
// Two ways a name is found, and the list says which:
//   `named` -- fm itself reports the reference under a key it documents
//              (`script`, `scriptReference`, `callback`, `layout`, `field`,
//              `vectorsField`, `labelsField`, `valueList`, `tableOccurrence`,
//              `context`, `startTable`, `table`, `style`, `from`, `breakField`,
//              `occurrence` + `field` pairs).
//   `text`  -- the name appears inside FileMaker calculation syntax, found by
//              tokenising the string. No key list decides where a formula may
//              live: EVERY string value of every described object goes through
//              `strings()`, whatever its key, and every one that is not a
//              literal name is tokenised.
//
// A Reference is { kind, name, resolved, how, from: { target, kind, id, name,
// where, stepID? } }. Conventions the rest of the analyses rely on:
//   * a `field` reference's `name` is `Occurrence::Field` -- that is what a
//     calculation writes and what the index is keyed on;
//   * a `variable` reference is always `resolved: false`. There is no catalog of
//     variables to resolve against, so the index cannot say; whether a `$$`
//     global is ever set is globals.js's question, not this one's. The one thing
//     this file reads the `Set Variable` steps for is SPELLING -- see
//     `setVariableNames` and the tokeniser -- which is not resolving;
//   * `from.stepID` is present exactly when the naming object is a script step.
//     It is fm's step TYPE id -- 141 is EVERY `Set Variable` -- so it identifies
//     what the step is, never which step it is, and it is NOT the anchor the
//     Scripts tab links to: that is FileMaker's 1-based line, `#L<line>`, built
//     from `from.where` (`body.<index>` + 1) by ui/tabs/explorer.js. It is kept
//     because a caller asking what KIND of step wrote a name would otherwise
//     have to find the step again;
//   * an occurrence's fields are the SOURCE file's: `nameIndex` follows
//     `table.dataSource` to the file that source opens, so a field entry's
//     `target` is where the field lives and `occurrenceTarget` where the name
//     that reaches it was written. `nameIndex(solution).unresolvedSources` lists
//     the occurrences whose source cannot be followed, each with a `reason`:
//     `unanswered` (no file in the read is named by it) or `ambiguous` (more
//     than one is, and the entry carries their `candidates`).
//
// `from.id` has four shapes, one per kind of owner:
//   * `field`                -> `BaseTable::Field`. A field belongs to a table,
//                               NOT to an occurrence: this string and a field
//                               reference's `name` look alike and are different
//                               namespaces.
//   * `layoutObject`         -> `<layoutId>.<objectId>`, fm's two numbers.
//   * `layout`, `script`, `valueList`, `customFunction`, `customMenu`,
//     `tableOccurrence`      -> fm's own numeric id for that object.
//   * `relation`             -> fm's numeric relation id; its `from.name` is
//                               `Left <-> Right`, because a relation has no name.
//   * `fileOptions`          -> the constant `'fileOptions'`. A file has exactly
//                               one File Options block and fm gives it no id, so
//                               there is nothing else it could be; `from.target`
//                               is what says which file's.
//
// The one thing the field-token rule can get wrong: an occurrence or field name
// containing a space or an operator character cannot be written in the token
// class, so `My TO::Field` in calculation text tokenises as `TO::Field` -- an
// invented name that then resolves to nothing. Measured on ooe: no occurrence,
// table or field name carries such a character, so it costs nothing there. On a
// solution that does, Task 3 would see a dangling name that is not one.
//
// Pure: no document, no node:, no server/. Every fm key read through access.js.
// Memoised through ui/analysis/memo.js, so a tab may ask as often as it likes
// and a re-read at ANY grain recomputes: the memo keys on the catalog slots a
// re-read swaps (`list`, `detailById`) and on `file.facts`, not on the solution
// object, which only a solution-grain re-read replaces. The memoised list and
// each index entry array are frozen: they are shared by every caller.
